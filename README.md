A simple /setfuel command for LegacyFuel ESX plugin.

# Usage:

/setfuel [player's id] [value; 0-100]

E. g.: /setfuel 26 100

# Requirements

es_extended

k5_notify - optional (default)

# Configuration

For notifications I used k5_notify, but inside of client.lua you can delete lines 8, 11, 16 and 19 and uncomment lines 7, 10, 15 and 18; in server.lua you can delete lines 15 and 19, and uncomment lines 14-18 to use the default "chat" messages.
